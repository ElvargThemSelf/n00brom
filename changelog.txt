* Replaced xpsend tool with the more capable xpcomms utility.

* Added PCDRV file access over Xplorer cartridge's parallel port. BIOS file
  functions such as open(), close(), read(), write(), firstfile() and 
  nextfile() are implemented.

* Some code tidying up.

* Temporarily replaced custom pad routines with BIOS pad routines, as custom
  pad routines aren't working properly on PAL units. Remember to turn off
  analog on controller when uploading via serial as the pad handler would slow
  down the kernel's interrupt handler enough to throw off SIO downloads.

* Improved reliability of built-in flasher by performing EEPROM writes with
  interrupts disabled.
